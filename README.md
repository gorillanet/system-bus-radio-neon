# system-bus-radio-neon

System Bus Radio for ARM NEON.  
This program is influenced by [system-bus-radio](https://github.com/fulldecent/system-bus-radio)

# What is this?

This program transmits radio from computers or phones worked on ARM CPU.

# How to use it

```
git clone https://github.com/yamaken0103/system-bus-radio-neon
cd system-bus-radio-neon
make
./neon
```
Move the radio closer to the machine and try to match the frequency 1000 kHz to 1600 kHz.  
You would hear the "Mary Had a Little Lamb" tune.  
I used a receiver "Sony ICF-P36".
